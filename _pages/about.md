Hi there! 👋

I'm a scientist and applied mathematician interested in modelling the human body and understanding the maths in those models. I'm currently a PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of Dr. [Eric Keaveny](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~ekeaveny/). Before starting my PhD, I was a researcher at the [Computational Medicine Group](https://github.com/comp-medicine-uc) of the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/) at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en).

Aside from research and teaching, I greatly enjoy music, gaming and hiking.
