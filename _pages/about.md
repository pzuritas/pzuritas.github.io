Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist and applied mathematician interested in (1) understanding the human body through mathematics and physics and (2) understanding the mathematics and physics that arise from study of the human body. I'm currently a researcher at the [Computational Medicine Group](https://github.com/comp-medicine-uc) of [Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en) (PUC). We are a part of the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/).

Aside from research and teaching, I greatly enjoy music, gaming and hiking.
