Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student interested in (1) understanding the human body through mathematics and physics and (2) understanding the mathematics and physics that arise from study of the human body. I'm currently a MSc. student at the [Computational Medicine Group](https://github.com/comp-medicine-uc) of [Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en) (PUC), under the supervision of Dr. [Daniel E. Hurtado](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Hurtado-4). We are a part of the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/).

Aside from research and teaching, I greatly enjoy critical music listening, gaming, hiking and bikepacking.
