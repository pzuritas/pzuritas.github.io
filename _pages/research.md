_Differential equations in pathophysiology._

The human body is a marvellous collection of systems where different kinds of physics are constantly at play. From cells to full organs, different elements in the body work across scales for the people who inhabit them, enabling them to live good lives. These systems can and do fail, and we can strive for a better understanding of how to fix their problems by looking at their underlying principles. My research is focused on the applications of mathematical analysis for the understanding of biophysical principles, and the development of computational tools to explore the functioning of biophysical systems.

Alveoli are the little structures in your lungs where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide leaves it. You breathe to make this happen, but nonetheless this process can fail locally for many reasons: if blood isn't flowing, if your red blood cell count is low, if air isn't going to the alveolus, or if the contents of said air are not quite right. These little alveoli are arranged in a fascinatingly intricate fashion, allowing for greater effectiveness and robustness of this crucial process. With [Dr. Daniel E. Hurtado](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Hurtado-4), we [worked](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782522004686) on developing a fully three-dimensional system of partial differential equations that models this phenomenon, and a numerical method to approximately solve it.

<!-- The system of equations turned out to be quite interesting, and with the guidance of [Dr. NicolÃ¡s A. Barnafi Wittwer](https://nabw.github.io/about.html), we [analysed]() it to uncover some fundamental properties regarding the behaviour of the system and its relationship to biomedical parameters that may be of interest to health professionals. -->

### Ciliated tissue biomechanics

The tissue that comprises your body is made of cells which, more often than not, are lined with tiny appendages called cilia. In some cases, such as your brain and airway, these cilia work like little mechanical arms that move surrounding fluid. Every time you inhale, for example, there's a chance that dangerous pathogens flow into your respiratory system. That's why your airways are lined with a complex fluid called mucus, that traps most of these pathogens. The cilia in your lung cells then move the mucus to expel it and keep you safe. I'm currently working with [Dr. Eric Keaveny](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~ekeaveny/) to model the properties and dynamics of this mechanical system.
