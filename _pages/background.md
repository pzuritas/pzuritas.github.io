I come from a long, thin and beautiful country called [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile), where you can see [the driest desert in the world bloom flowers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/chile-atacama-desert-wildflower-super-bloom-video-spd#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20driest%20regions,desierto%20florido%20(flowering%20desert).), [kayak through marble tunnels](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capilla_de_M%C3%A1rmol), [bathe in forest-surrounded hilltop lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huerquehue_National_Park) and much, much more.
